# Additional Card Addition Rules (user-specified)

- Boost attack penalty: When a card has a `boost` specified, the card's attack should be set to be two times worse than the average attack for its declared rank (or two times worse than the intended attack). This is a content-guideline for card creators.

- SS/UR boost behavior: If an `SS` or `UR` rank card is a boost (i.e., it has a `boost` field) and does not include a special attack, do NOT add a special attack for that card.

- Team boost behavior: When a card grants a team boost, that boost only applies to cards in the same user's active team, and only if the boosting card is also present in that team. UI note: render the boost percentage on the team image canvas (small text at the bottom-left), e.g. "20% boost".

Note: The repository currently enforces that `boost`/`artifact` cards have `attack_min` and `attack_max` set to `0` at flatten-time. If you want the engine to reflect the "two times worse" rule instead of zeroing attacks, the runtime clamping logic in `data/cards.js` must be adjusted accordingly.
